I am a last year PhD student at Lund University in ATLAS group.
My thesis will focus on beyond Standard Model physics searches with leptons.
My first analysis was "Search for anomalous production of prompt same-sign lepton pairs with ATLAS".
Fiducial cross-section limits were derived for contributions from new physics beyond the SM, which
give rise to final states with two same-sign isolated leptons. Limits were also set for a model of doubly charged
Higgs bosons. My responsobility was di-electron channel.


In parallel I was working with Transition Radiation Tracker (TRT) group of the ATLAS, where 
I made a first implementation of new Argon-based active gas mixture to the official TRT ATLAS simulation code.
My curent analysis is search of heavy W' boson in lepton channel with 13 TeV data.
Main activity is related with investigation of high momenta lepton selection criteria, isolation requirements and missing transverse energy.
On the hardware side, I was involved on developing, installation and testing of the newly-built ATLAS luminosity detector LUCID for the Run-2. 
I continue developing of calibration procedure for LUCID and I am taking part in ATLAS Forward Detector run coordination.
